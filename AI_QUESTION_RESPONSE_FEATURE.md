# Issue: Implement AI-powered Question Response Feature

## Feature Description
Enable students to submit image-based questions and receive AI-generated responses within the app.

## Requirements
- Allow students to upload images containing questions
- Process the image to extract question content
- Send the extracted content to an AI API
- Display the AI-generated response to the student
- Implement a minimalist UI for the question-response flow (not a continuous chat)
- Store question-answer history for student reference

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Data Models
Create new models:
- `StudentQuestionModel` - To store student questions with image references
- `AiResponseModel` - To store AI responses for questions

### 2. UI Components
- Create a new page `ask_question_page.dart` for question submission
- Implement image upload functionality with camera and gallery options
- Design a response view to display AI answers
- Create a history page to show previous questions and answers

### 3. Services
- Extend the existing `OpenAiService` to handle image-based questions
- Add methods to process images and extract text if needed
- Create a new service `StudentQuestionService` to manage question storage and retrieval

### 4. Firebase Integration
- Set up appropriate Firebase Storage paths for question images
- Create Firestore collections for questions and answers
- Implement security rules for user-specific access

## Implementation Breakdown

### Step 1: Data Models
1. Create model classes for questions and responses
2. Implement serialization/deserialization methods

### Step 2: Service Layer
1. Extend the OpenAI service to support the new feature
2. Create a new service for managing student questions
3. Implement methods for saving questions and responses to Firebase

### Step 3: UI Implementation
1. Design and implement question submission UI
2. Create an image picker component with camera/gallery options
3. Implement the response display UI
4. Build a history view for past questions

### Step 4: Integration and Testing
1. Connect all components together
2. Test with various image types and sizes
3. Optimize for performance and user experience

## Acceptance Criteria
- Students can upload question images through the app
- AI responds with relevant answers to the questions
- Responses are displayed clearly on the screen
- Question-answer history is accessible to students
- UI is intuitive and follows the app's design language

## Additional Notes
- Consider rate limiting to prevent API abuse
- Implement error handling for failed image uploads or API calls
- Account for potential OCR inaccuracies when extracting text from images
- Optimize image storage to reduce bandwidth and storage costs
