# Exam Assistant App - Technical Summary

## Project Overview
Exam Assistant (YKS Asistan) is a comprehensive Flutter mobile application designed to help students prepare for the Turkish university entrance examination (YKS). The app offers a structured approach to exam preparation through question practice, progress tracking, and personalized learning.

## Application Architecture

### Frontend (Flutter)
The application uses Flutter with Material Design 3 for the user interface, providing a modern and responsive experience across different devices.

### Backend Services
- **Firebase Authentication**: User account management and authentication
- **Cloud Firestore**: Database for questions, categories, topics, and user progress
- **Firebase Storage**: Storage for images and other media content
- **Firebase Database**: Real-time database for certain features

### Local Data Management
- **Hive**: Local NoSQL database for caching questions and user settings
- **SharedPreferences**: For storing basic user preferences

### Directory Structure
- **lib/**: Main application code
  - **auth/**: Authentication logic and screens
  - **model/**: Data models for questions and user information
  - **pages/**: Main application screens
  - **router/**: Navigation using GoRouter
  - **service/**: Services for API communication and data management
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
  - **widgets/**: Reusable UI components

## Core Features

### 1. Question and Exam Practice
The app provides a comprehensive question database organized by:
- Categories (main subject areas)
- Lessons (specific subjects)
- Topics (focused areas within subjects)
- Subtopics (detailed breakdown of topics)

Questions are presented in a format similar to the real exam, with multiple-choice options and detailed explanations. The app tracks solved questions and provides analytics on performance.

### 2. Daily Goals and Progress Tracking
- **Goal Setting**: Users can set daily study goals per subject
- **Progress Monitoring**: Visual representation of goal completion
- **Usage Statistics**: Tracking app usage and study time

### 3. Statistics and Analytics
- **Performance Metrics**: Visualization of correct vs. incorrect answers
- **Time-based Analysis**: Weekly, monthly, and all-time statistics
- **Subject-specific Performance**: Data visualization per subject area
- **Charts**: Interactive charts showing progress over time

### 4. Lessons and Learning Materials
- **Structured Content**: Organized educational content by topics
- **WebView Integration**: Access to external learning resources
- **Notes**: Ability to save notes and important information

### 5. User Account System
- **Profile Management**: User profile with settings and preferences
- **Cloud Synchronization**: Data synced across devices
- **Authentication**: Email and Google sign-in options

## Technical Implementations

### State Management
The application uses a service-based architecture with Firebase and local storage to manage state.

### Data Caching Strategy
- Questions are cached locally using Hive to reduce network requests
- Periodic synchronization with the cloud database

### Navigation
- GoRouter for declarative routing and navigation
- Structured navigation paths based on categories and topics

### Firebase Integration
- Firebase Authentication for user management
- Firestore for structured data storage
- Real-time updates for user progress

### Performance Optimization
- Image caching for questions with images
- Lazy loading of content
- Pagination for large datasets

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- OpenAI integration for generating similar questions and study aids
- Advanced analytics for identifying learning patterns
- Collaborative features for group study
- Expanded content coverage for additional exam types

## Target Audience
Students preparing for the Turkish university entrance examination (YKS), with potential adaptation for other standardized tests and educational contexts.
