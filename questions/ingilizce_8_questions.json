    "question": "Answer the following question according to the paragraph.\nHi, I’m Jeremy. I went to Walt Disney World in Orlando, Florida with my family last summer. It was my favourite vacation. It was a long trip. Since my mother was afraid of flying, we travelled by my dad’s camper. There are four main parks at Walt Disney World: The Magic Kingdom, Epcot, Hollywood Studios, and Animal Kingdom. We went on attractions in these theme parks and I had lots of fun. We went on rides with my dad and siblings. We went on Splash Mountain and rode on logs. We went through a tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, everyone got wet. It was a breath-taking experience for me. At the theme parks, we saw different Disney characters. Dad took many photos of me with them. At Epcot Centre, we watched spectacular fireworks show and had fun. The shows were amazing and the land itself was so pretty. This was one of the most unforgettable vacation for all of us and we were contented with being there.\nThe fireworks display was ......  and the holiday was a breath-taking experience for me.",

Situated on a hill named Rasattepe, it covers 700,000 square metres of land and includes a park where plants from all parts of Turkey and the world can be found. It took nine years to complete the mausoleum. Fifteen years after Atatürk’s death, on November 10<sup>th</sup>, 1953, his coffin was taken from the Ethnography Museum of Ankara and brought to Anıtkabir with a great ceremony.
